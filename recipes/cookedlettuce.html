  <p>When it comes to this cooked lettuce with garlic oyster sauce, simplicity is the name of the game. Once you prepare this easy recipe, it’ll become clear that you don’t need to over-work for a tasty dish.</p>

  <h2>Cooked lettuce?</h2>
  <p>Yes, cooked lettuce! In Chinese cuisine, cooking lettuce is not unusual. Actually, it’s more often cooked than served raw.</p>

  <p>In fact, stir-fried lettuce is a cherished “good luck” recipe served around Chinese New Year. In Chinese, the word for lettuce is shēngcài (生菜) in Mandarin or saung choy in Cantonese. It’s actually a homonym for shēngcái (生财), which means “to make money.”</p>

  <p>So, eating lettuce symbolizes wealth and prosperity!</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>10 ounces romaine lettuce</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon light soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons water</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Separate the romaine into individual leaves. Wash the leaves clean, paying special attention to the base of the stems, which hold the most dirt! Drain, leaving the leaves whole.</li>
    <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over medium heat, heat 2 tablespoons of oil. Add the minced garlic, light soy sauce, oyster sauce and 3 tablespoons of water. Bring the mixture to a simmer, and then turn off the heat. Set aside.</li>
    <li>When your water is boiling, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil, along with the romaine lettuce leaves. Cook for about 20 seconds, to lightly wilt the lettuce. Immediately scoop them out of the pot. Drain off any excess water, and lay them on a serving plate</li>
    <li>Pour the sauce over the top, and serve immediately.</li>
  </ol>
