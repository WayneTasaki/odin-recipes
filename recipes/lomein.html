  <p>When it comes to cooking Asian dishes like vegetable lo mein, itâ€™s not hard at all. It just comes down to the ingredients and the method of cooking.</p>
  <p>Vegetable Lo Mein is perfect as a side dish or main dish for dinner. This easy lo mein recipe is quick, easy-to-follow and inexpensive to make! Feel free to customize it with whatever vegetables you have on hand.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 to 3 teaspoons fresh ginger minced</li>
    <li>3 garlic cloves minced</li>
    <li>1 cup bok choy chopped (both green and white parts)</li>
    <li>2 large carrots peeled and chopped</li>
    <li>1/2 red bell pepper chopped</li>
    <li>8 oz shiitake or oyster mushrooms chopped</li>
    <li>8 ounces fresh or dried lo mein egg noodles</li>
    <li>1 cup fresh bean sprouts</li>
    <li>1 to 2 cups snow peas</li>
    <li>1/4 cup vegetable broth</li>
    <li>1/2 cup hoisin sauce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce + more if needed</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
    <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 green onions diced for garnish</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Using a large nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. After a minute or so, add ginger and garlic and saute for a minute or two. Add all of the vegetables from the bok choy to the mushrooms and cook for about 4 to 5 minutes, or until the vegetables begin to soften a bit. Feel free to add a touch more vegetable oil if needed.</li>
    <li>Next, add in the egg noodles and stir to combine. Cook for about 2 minutes and then add in bean sprouts and snow peas and cook for about 3 minutes or so. Add in the vegetable broth, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, and honey. Bring the mixture to a boil and stir until slightly reduced and thick, for about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste and garnish with the diced green onions before serving.</li>
